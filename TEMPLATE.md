## Introduction

This project demonstrates how to use an ESP32 DevBoard to control a digital privacy window (such as an electrochromic or liquid crystal film) using voltage. By toggling a GPIO pin, the ESP32 can switch the window between transparent and opaque states, enabling dynamic control for privacy or solar heat management.

### Learning Objectives

Understand Microcontroller Integration:
Learn how to interface an ESP32 DevBoard with external hardware, specifically electrochromic or liquid crystal privacy window films, to enable electronic control of transparency using GPIO pins.

Implement Digital Output Control:
Develop the ability to program the ESP32 to toggle voltage outputs, switching the privacy window between transparent and opaque states for dynamic privacy or solar heat management.

Design and Test Embedded Systems:
Gain experience in designing, assembling, and troubleshooting embedded systems that combine hardware (window film, drivers) and software (ESP32 firmware).

Apply Circuit Design Principles:
Apply knowledge of circuit design, including safe voltage switching and component interfacing, to ensure reliable operation of the privacy window control circuit.

Develop and Debug Firmware:
Write and debug firmware for the ESP32 using common development environments (e.g., Arduino IDE), focusing on GPIO control and system reliability.

Document and Communicate Engineering Work:
Practice documenting system architecture, code, and troubleshooting steps, and effectively communicate the design process and outcomes in a technical report.

Reflect on Engineering Challenges:
Identify and analyze challenges encountered during hardware integration and troubleshooting, and articulate lessons learned for future embedded systems projects.

### Background Information

A digital privacy window uses special films—such as electrochromic or liquid crystal film—that can switch between transparent and opaque states when a voltage is applied. In this project, an ESP32 DevBoard is programmed to control the privacy window by toggling a GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) pin. When the GPIO pin is set high or low, it changes the voltage applied to the window film, instantly switching its state. This allows users to dynamically manage privacy and sunlight in a room with the push of a button or via automated controls.

## Getting Started

1. Arduino IDE
What is it?
The Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a user-friendly platform for writing, compiling, and uploading code to microcontroller boards like the ESP32.

Why use it?
It simplifies programming and supports a wide range of boards, including the ESP32. It’s cross-platform and has extensive community support.

Installation Steps:

Windows: Download the installer from the Arduino Software page and run it. Follow the on-screen instructions.

macOS: Download the .zip file from the Arduino Software page, extract it, and move the Arduino app to your Applications folder.

Linux: Download the appropriate package from the Arduino Software page. Extract and run the install script in a terminal.
