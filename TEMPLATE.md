## Introduction

This tutorial will guide you through building a Digital Privacy Window system using an ESP32 DevBoard to control a switchable (electrochromic or liquid crystal) window film. The motivation is to enable dynamic privacy and solar control for smart homes, offices, or any space where on-demand window opacity is desirable. By following this tutorial, you will gain hands-on experience in embedded programming, hardware integration, and smart device prototyping.

### Learning Objectives

- Interface an ESP32 DevBoard with a digital privacy window film.
- Program the ESP32 to control window transparency via GPIO.
- Understand the principles behind electrochromic and liquid crystal films.
- Assemble, test, and troubleshoot basic embedded hardware.
- Document and communicate technical processes and results.

### Background Information

A digital privacy window uses switchable film (electrochromic or liquid crystal) that changes between transparent and opaque states when voltage is applied. This technology is used in offices, healthcare, retail, and homes to provide privacy at the touch of a button or via automation. The ESP32 DevBoard is a powerful, Wi-Fi/Bluetooth-enabled microcontroller that can be programmed to control such films through its GPIO pins.

**Alternatives:**  
- Smart blinds/shades (mechanical, less sleek)
- Traditional curtains (manual, less automated)
- Other microcontrollers (Arduino Uno, less powerful than ESP32)

**Key Concepts:**  
- *PDLC (Polymer Dispersed Liquid Crystal)*: Film scatters light when unpowered, becomes clear when voltage aligns the crystals.
- *Electrochromic Film*: Tints gradually with voltage.
- *GPIO*: General-purpose input/output pin on the ESP32, used to switch the window state.

## Part 02: Understanding and Preparing the Privacy Window Film

### Introduction

This section introduces switchable privacy films and prepares you for installation and testing.

### Objective

- Understand how electrochromic and liquid crystal films work.
- Prepare the film for installation and testing.
- Learn best practices for handling and cleaning.

### Background Information

Switchable films use voltage to change between clear and opaque states. Proper handling and testing before installation are critical to avoid damage.

### Components

- Privacy window film (electrochromic or LC)
- Power supply (per film specs)
- Clean glass or acrylic panel

### Instructional

1. Inspect the film for any damage before use.
2. Test the film by connecting it to the power supply; observe the transition between states.
3. Clean the glass thoroughly before applying the film—80% of installation issues are due to dirt.
4. Carefully peel and apply the film, following manufacturer’s instructions for alignment and adhesion.
5. Connect film wiring to the power supply, ensuring correct polarity and voltage.

## Example

### Introduction

We’ll test the privacy film’s switching function before installation.

### Example

**Visual:**

## Part 03: Wiring and Controlling the Privacy Window with ESP32

### Introduction

This section covers connecting the ESP32 to the privacy film and programming it to control transparency via a GPIO pin.

### Objective

- Wire the ESP32 to a relay or MOSFET for safe film control.
- Write code to toggle the film’s state.
- Test dynamic switching via software.

### Background Information

The ESP32 cannot drive the film directly (due to voltage/current requirements), so a relay or MOSFET acts as a switch. GPIO pins send control signals to these components.

### Components

- ESP32 DevBoard
- Relay or MOSFET module
- Privacy window film (installed)
- Jumper wires
- Power supply (for film)

### Instructional

1. Connect the ESP32 GPIO pin to the relay or MOSFET control input.
2. Wire the relay/MOSFET output to the privacy film and its power supply.
3. In Arduino IDE, write a sketch that toggles the GPIO pin HIGH/LOW to switch the film.
4. Upload the code and observe the window film switching between states.

---

## Example

### Introduction

Let’s program the ESP32 to switch the privacy film on and off with a button press.

### Example

#define FILM_PIN 5

void setup() {
pinMode(FILM_PIN, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
digitalWrite(FILM_PIN, HIGH); // Film ON (clear)
delay(5000);
digitalWrite(FILM_PIN, LOW); // Film OFF (opaque)
delay(5000);
}
